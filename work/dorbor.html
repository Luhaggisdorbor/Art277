    <p id="font-family"><b><strong>Travelling in depression</strong></b></p>
    <p id="position">When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my
        grandparents first
        brought<br>
        me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each
        has<br>
        given me a unique learning experience.</p>
    <p id="position">At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was
        eight, I stood
        in the<br>

        </a> heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then
        glided down Venetian waterways<br>
        on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge
        and<br>
        <a href="">
            <img id="small" src="photo.png.jpeg" alt=""></a> walked along the Great Wall of China,
        amazed that
        the<br>
        thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in<br>
        <a href="http://Starz.com">Starz University</a>.
    </p>
    <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first<br>
        became interested in language.<br>
    </p>
    It began with French, which taught me the importance of<br>
    pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris<br>
    where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it<br>
    PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<br>
    the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
    <p id="position">In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and<br>
        aware of its similarities with English through cognates.<br>
        Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks<br>
        different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to<br>
        me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that
        cognates<br>
        come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href="dluhaggis@gmail.com">Send

            Email</a></p>
    <p id="position">Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied
        Chinese at my
        <br>
        school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is
        lost. I<br>
    </p>
    <p id="position">loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ
        (火) meaning<br>
        fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means<br>
        volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the
        beauty<br>
        and rhythm as I form them.</p>
