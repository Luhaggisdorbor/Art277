    <h2>Re: Albert Momo university application</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
    <p>Thank you for the recent application to join us at the starz University's science faculty to study<br>as part
        of
        your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the followong sections.</p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br>us better
        if
        you could start at the beginning of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br>Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>Third semester: 2 May 2023</p>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about important university dates on my website.</p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects<br>fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br>researcher, and
        just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas<br>you submitted we were
        most
        intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <p>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<br>Measuring the effect on
        performance
        of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30&deg;C (86&#8457;),<br>when the audience size exponentially
        increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup> .)</p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are rigt! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. to<br>answer your
        question, my favourite dancees are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village<br>would dance around
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the islanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they use to pratice<br>this dance, which
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the flood, and shuffling<br>their bodies around in
        imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br>students used to say that he thought this
        dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of history misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br>believed to have
        discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br>movements, being praticed by inhabitants
        of Norhern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br>however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
        because thet were really cold.</dd>

    <p>Your sincerely,</p>
